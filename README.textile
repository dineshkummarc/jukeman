h1. JukeMan

h2. JukeMan is a simple rails app with an iTunes like interface for uploading music into its library, and then organizing that music into playlists. This is NOT A MUSIC PLAYER, just a server that manages songs and playlists. Daniel is making a program that runs on Ubuntu and interacts with Amarok, that will "poll" this server for songs and playlists, and then make amarok play one of those playlists.
